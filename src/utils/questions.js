    question: `What is a service like?`,
    answer: `Our gatherings are simple and sacred. Come as you are, connect with
            others, and enjoy some coffee. Each gathering is about one hour and
            a half and includes a meaningful message and some great music.
            Church should be fun, laid back, and authentic.`,
